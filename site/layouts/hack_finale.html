        <h3>Why Hack Nights?</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional weekend hackathons are great for students to focus and build amazing projects in a sprint. In fact, <a href="http://ubhacking.com" target="_blank">UB Hacking</a> is so successful it is now ran as an independent event! We've seen great projects from hackathons, and hope to see them productionize and mature over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's where Hack Nights come in. We want to encourage students to work on long-term projects. Hack Nights are hack sessions students can work together, in a similar environment as a hackathon.
